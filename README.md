The Gishushu Traffic Lights system consists of three main states: Green, Yellow, and Red. 

The traffic lights cycle through these states to control the flow of traffic at an intersection.

**Green State**: The traffic light is green, allowing vehicles to pass. This state lasts for a predefined duration (e.g., 30 seconds).

**Yellow State**: The light turns yellow, indicating that the signal is about to change to red. 
This state lasts for a short duration (e.g., 5 seconds), warning drivers to prepare to stop.

**Red State**: The light is red, stopping vehicles from passing. This state also lasts for a predefined duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
After the red light, the system transitions back to the green state, and the cycle repeats.
